			<h2>Disaster preparedness: What to pack in your emergency ‘Go Bag’</h2>
		<span>
			<p>Tropical cyclones can hit the country any time of the year, with months of June to September being the most active.</p>

			<p>Aside from typhoons, the Philippines is also prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity as it sits on the pacific ‘ring of fire’.</p>

			<p>When living in an area prone to natural calamities, it is always a smart idea to prepare for the worst-case scenario, and one way to stay safe in the midst of a sudden crisis is by packing a ‘Go Bag’.</p>

			<p>A ‘Go Bag’ is a backpack or duffel bag filled with survival essentials you can grab and take with you when disaster strikes.</p>

			<p>Its contents may vary according to personal or your family’s needs but should include a few staple items one would require to survive for 72 hours (3 days) when evacuating from a disaster.</p>

			<p>So, what items should you pack in your emergency ‘Go Bag’?<br>
				<ul>
					<li>At least four liters of water</li>
					<li>Non-perishable food items</li>
					<li>Photocopies of legal documents and identification cards</li>
					<li>First Aid / medicine kit</li>
					<li>Hygiene kit</li>
					<li>Heavy-duty flashlight</li>
					<li>Extra clothes</li>
					<li>Raincoat and Blanket</li>
					<li>Extra cash</li>
					<li>Additional essentials</li>
					<li>Family’s special needs</li>
				</ul>
